Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
        Software engineering is the process of designing, creating, and maintaining software. It is important to the technology sector because it makes it possible to use            technical equipment and devices to complete activities more quickly and easily. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
    Developing of programming languages such as Fotran.
    Establishing as a software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
    Rise of agile methodologies in 2000's.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    Requirements- Gathering and documentation of system requirements and user needs.
    Design- Creating high-level designs for user interface.
    Implementation- Writing code and building software according to the design specification.
    Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure software meets quality standards.
    Deployment- Releasing software to users.
    Maintainance- Providing ongoing support, updates and enhacements of software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    Waterfall methodology is linear and sequential as its requirements  are gathered upfront while Agile methodology is iterative and incremential as its requirements are        gathered overtime and prioritized.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
      Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures quality of software products as they test them, identify defects and maintain their compliance.
      Project Manager- He/she oversees planning, execution of software projects.
      
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    Integrated Development Environments- It helps in testing and debugging of codes for example VS code.
    Version Control Systems- It allwos coordination of work in teams as well as tracking of changes in a test code for example Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
     Tights deadlines- Engineers whould be able to prioritize tasks.
     Changing requirements- There should be effective communication when things are needed to make changes.
     Technical debts- They could use agile methodology as they gain ideas from teams on what to improve in the system.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
     Unit Testing is referred to as a test that isused to check whether module has veen developed correctly.
     Integration Testing is a test that focuses on data transfer from one end to another.
     System Testing is refferred to a testing method concerned with behaviour of the system as a whole.
     Acceptance Testing checks if the system meets the requirements of the end user.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
    Prompt engineering involves the creation of input prompts to produce a desired outcome with the continuous goal of ensuring these outputs are accurate and appropriate.       Its importance in AI models is to identify prompts that produce an appropriate and accessible output. An example is a chatbot.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
        Vague prompt is a prompt that is not clear and specific and that does not communicate what one is looking for. A way to improve it is to clearly communicate and be           specific to what you are looking for through your prompt and esnure it is straight to the point.
